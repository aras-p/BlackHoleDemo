# Black Hole demo by nesnausk! (2020)

A real-time rendering demo. 1st place at [Field-FX 2020](https://field-fx.party/).

The soundtrack was made in early
21st century, I got an idea to make a demo with it around year
2006, but it took a lot more years until I actually did something.

Sometime in 2018 I sat down with my kid and we started making
something.

And then that got parked, until I got off my lazy arse and actually
finished it up, mid-2020. So here it is!

### Details

It's a Unity 2018.2 project with nothing fancy really. A timeline,
and mostly raymarched fractals that render into the g-buffer. Some utilities
I've used from the most excellent [Keijiro's github](https://github.com/keijiro),
and the fractals are based on "[Kali Sets](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/kalisets-and-hybrid-ducks/)",
particularly "[kalizyl and kalizul](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtlGR2)" shadertoy by Stefan Berke.
